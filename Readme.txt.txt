A Quick Note:
   Sorry to those who downloaded the previous source... I completely forgot to include the comments! :p

-== QuickComm PC - PC ==-

   QuickComm PC - PC is a UDP Communications program using the MSWINSCK (Microsoft Winsock) control. With an IP address and a Name, this program allows you to communicate to other users on the fly, without having to set up a connection.
   Useful for people with cable connections who like to have communications with friends. :)

   In addition to the simple communications allowed, QuickComm also slides up when not in use, much like an Auto-Hide Taskbar. If incoming data is displayed while hidden, a sound is played, then a small Incoming Message window is displayed at the bottom-right corner of the screen until the user views the incoming text.

To use:
   Run the included EXE file (or run it in the IDE with the source). Set your name to whatever you wish, and set the IP address to your target. The IP you supply must be valid, and point to a computer also running QuickComm. You can specify your own IP address (or 127.0.0.1 for localhost) to talk to yourself, testing the capabilities.

   I have included one command that can be used with QuickComm. /beep (must be in lowercase) plays the default beep sound. Good for notifying the other party of important information, or just to annoy them. >)
