### Description

QuickComm PC - PC is a UDP Communications program using the MSWINSCK (Microsoft Winsock) control. With an IP address and a Name, this program allows you to communicate to other users on the fly, without having to set up a connection. Useful for people with cable connections who like to have communications with friends. :) In addition to the simple communications allowed, QuickComm also slides up when not in use, much like an Auto-Hide Taskbar. If incoming data is displayed while hidden, a sound is played, then a small Incoming Message window is displayed at the bottom-right corner of the screen until the user views the incoming text. Download it and check it out. :) If you're looking for help on UDP protocol with Winsock, it's fully commented. If you're just looking for a quick way to talk to someone, it's reliable.
